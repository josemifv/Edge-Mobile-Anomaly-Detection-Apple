19. SCRIPT ORGANIZATION CLEANUP COMPLETED
=========================================

Task: Reorganize utility scripts to avoid confusion with pipeline stage numbering
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Changes Made:
- Renamed 06_cell_aggregation.py → utils_cell_aggregation.py
- Renamed 06_cell_aggregation_demo.py → demo_cell_aggregation.py
- Updated all internal filename references in the renamed scripts
- Updated .context file to reflect new script organization

Rationale:
- Pipeline stages should use numbered prefixes (01_, 02_, 03_, etc.)
- Utility scripts should use descriptive prefixes (utils_, demo_, etc.)
- This prevents confusion about what is part of the main pipeline vs utility tools

Current Script Organization:
✅ Pipeline Scripts: 01_ through 07_ (numbered stages)
✅ Utility Scripts: utils_ prefix (standalone tools)
✅ Demo Scripts: demo_ prefix (performance comparisons)
✅ Analysis Scripts: analyze_ prefix (research tools)
✅ Benchmark Scripts: benchmark_ prefix (performance testing)

Clear Separation:
- 06_generate_anomaly_map.py = Stage 6 of the main pipeline
- utils_cell_aggregation.py = Utility script for cell aggregation
- demo_cell_aggregation.py = Performance comparison demo

Files Affected:
✅ scripts/utils_cell_aggregation.py (renamed from 06_cell_aggregation.py)
✅ scripts/demo_cell_aggregation.py (renamed from 06_cell_aggregation_demo.py)
✅ .context file updated with new organization

==========================================
Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Clean Script Organization
Last Updated: June 2025 - Script Naming Cleanup
==========================================

20. REPOSITORY REORGANIZATION COMPLETED

   - scripts/utils/analyze_severe_anomalies.py (severity analysis tools)
   - scripts/utils/benchmark_parameter_sweep.py (parameter optimization)
   - scripts/utils/benchmark_micro_test.py (quick system validation)
   - scripts/utils/utils_cell_aggregation.py (cell-level aggregation)
   - scripts/utils/demo_cell_aggregation.py (performance comparison demo)
   - scripts/utils/validate_pipeline_data.py (pipeline validation)

✅ Created outputs/reports/ directory structure for organized report storage

✅ Cleaned output files from repository root

Benefits:
- Clear separation between pipeline stages and utility tools
- Better organization for academic publication
- Cleaner repository structure for CMMSE 2025 submission
- Centralized location for analysis reports and outputs
